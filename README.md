# lil-scripts

This repository contains a collection of small scripts that I have written to automate some tasks.

## Installation

To install the scripts, you can clone this repository and run the `install.sh` script.\
This will install all the required dependencies and add the `lil-scripts` directory to your `PATH`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kan-A-Pesh/lil-scripts.git
cd lil-scripts
./install.sh
```

## Uninstallation

If you want to uninstall the scripts, you can run the `uninstall.sh` script.

> **Note:** This will remove the `lil-scripts` directory from your `PATH` and delete all the scripts.

```bash
cd lil-scripts
./uninstall.sh
```

## List of scripts

-   [**`lil-help`**](lil-help): A script to display help messages for all the scripts in this repository.
-   [**`dps`**](dps): A simple wrapper around `docker ps` that adds some color to the output and makes it easier to read.
